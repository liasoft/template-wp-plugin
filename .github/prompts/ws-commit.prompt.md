Your task:
Review the current local changes, stage if not already staged, and commit with a meaningful message.

Commit Process:
1. Examine all modified, added, or deleted files
2. Verify code quality, best practices, performance, security, and maintainability
3. Check for any leftover comments, debug code, or temporary changes
4. Ensure all changes are intentional and production-ready
5. Stage the changes if not already staged
6. Create a clear, descriptive commit message following conventional commit format
7. Commit the changes

Commit Message Guidelines:
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Keep the summary under 50 characters
- Include body with more details if needed
