Your task:
Review the current local changes and provide feedback without staging or committing anything.

Review Process:
1. Examine all modified, added, or deleted files
2. Analyze code quality, best practices, performance, security, and maintainability
3. Identify potential issues, improvements, or concerns
4. Check for leftover comments, debug code, or temporary changes
5. Verify adherence to project coding standards and conventions
6. Provide specific recommendations with examples when possible

Review Focus Areas:
- Code quality and readability
- Performance implications
- Security vulnerabilities or best practices
- WordPress coding standards compliance
- Documentation completeness
- Error handling and edge cases
- Potential breaking changes
- Check if CHANGELOG.md needs updates for any new features, fixes, or changes

Documentation Review:
- Verify that significant changes are documented in CHANGELOG.md
- Ensure README.md stays current with new features
- Check that breaking changes are clearly noted
- Confirm version numbers are consistent across files

Do NOT stage or commit any changes. Only provide analysis and recommendations.
